### A two-line introduction to the gist of the package


The [SyncroSim](https://syncrosim.com/) **NetLogo** package is designed to provide an interface for the [NetLogo model](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

The **NetLogo** package for SyncroSim allows users to structure scenario input and output data, run the model and explore model outputs using either a graphical user interface (GUI), a command line interface or the [rsyncrosim](https://syncrosim.com/r-package/) package for [R](https://www.r-project.org/). The initial version of the **NetLogo** package was written against NetLogo version 6.1.1.
